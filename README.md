# Machine Learning to Predict Digital Frustration from Clickstream Data

This repository contains the supplementary notebook code for my paper:

**Machine Learning to Predict Digital Frustration from Clickstream Data**
arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20438

The paper is currently under review at **SN Computer Science**.

## Repository Content

* `supplementary_material_notebook.ipynb`
  This notebook contains the main code used for preprocessing the clickstream data, creating frustration labels, feature engineering, training machine learning models, and evaluating the results.

## About the Work

In this work, I use the public Coveo e-commerce clickstream dataset to predict digital frustration in user sessions.

Frustration is defined using rule-based behavioural signals such as:

* Rage bursts
* U-turns
* Cart churn
* Search struggle
* Long wandering sessions

The notebook includes the steps for:

* Sessionization of raw clickstream data
* Symbolization of user actions
* Rule-based frustration labelling
* Feature engineering using n-grams, HVG motifs, entropy, and cyclical time features
* Training standard machine learning models
* Training an LSTM classifier
* Early-window frustration prediction

## Dataset

This work uses the public Coveo e-commerce clickstream dataset.

The dataset is not included in this repository. Anyone using this code should download the dataset from the original Coveo source and follow their dataset terms and conditions. Link
